Here lies Project 1 and Project 2 for this semester.

To run project 1, I recommend an IDE such as Intellij or Eclipse.

Import the file via the archive file, and run the tests via Junit.

An in depth review of project1 (project 2) is included to read at your leisure. But a summary will be included here, in the readme.

>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing. Testing that code meets the required functionality, and that the code is stable and has expected outputs
from known inputs.

>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by looking at user stories and creating requirements. From the requirements, I can make use
cases to test code with. If requirements are already laid bare, focusing on refinement of requirements should be the next issue.

>How do I approach designing software?

Decide what the software is for, and pick a stable design pattern to suit the needs of the user. As soon as a pattern is selected
the small details can be tackled.
